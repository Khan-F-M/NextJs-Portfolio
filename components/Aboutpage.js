                        is biryani. I have very few people I would consider friends. This paragraph is soley for the purpose of filling in the blanks.
                        In all brutal honesty my life is not the most interesting one. I'm supose to add some animation to
                        this component but that would require framer motion and I've already uninstalled it. The page isn't looking so good
                        no cap. Looks kinda ugly lowkey. Might have to switch back to the original tutorial because that dudes website
                        looked way cleaner. His is carried by animation. I also have some quotes that I like.
