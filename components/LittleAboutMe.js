                I'm a Seneca College student. I am currently studying in
                the Computer Programming(CPP) program as Seneca. My passion
                is coding, specifically Web Development. Although I have more
                experience and projects working with C++, I've always been
                wanting to switch towards the Web side of programming.

            <p className='text-base md:text-base lg:text-xl hover:text-fuchsia-700 hover:font-bold'>Unfortunetly, as of right now, I don't have any intership
                or job experience with Web Development. However, I have
                been studying this pathway for over a year now, and feel
                confident that I would be a great addition to any team requiring
                a web developer.
